# Harware-Hacking

Attending [jQuery UK](http://jqueryuk.com/) in Oxford last week I went to the "The Rise of JavaScript Hardware Hacking" talk and was incredibly inspired.

## Ideas List

Here's some ideas of what I'd like to be able to create with nodejs and an Arduino and a computer: 

* Control LEDs - e.g. to show the hour of the day.
* Temperature sensor - track temperature in/out/wherever
* Weight sensor - e.g. for milk in fridge, number of biscuits in barrel, amount of rain fall.
* Motor - e.g. to open and close the blind in our bedroom.
* Webcam
* Quadcoptor
